- Study of
  [Exploration vs. Exploitation](https://github.com/shirazkn/reinforcement-learning/blob/master/code/exploration_vs_exploitation.ipynb)
  using a maze-solving problem.

- [Value learning](https://github.com/shirazkn/reinforcement-learning/blob/master/code/horse_notebook.ipynb)
  using a made-up (horse chasing) example.
